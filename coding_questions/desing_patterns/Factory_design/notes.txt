Factory design pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under 'Creational Pattern'.
As this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an Object.

In Factory pattern, we create objects without exposing the creation logic for the client
and refer to newly created objects through a common interface.

Here, in this example : 

shape is an interface,
circle, sqaure, rectangle are the classes which implements shape interface
shapeFctory is a class used to create Objects, without exposing creation logic to Client.
In main class, we are passing 'CIRCLE' OR 'RECTANGLE', OR 'SQUARE' to create Objects internally.

So, it is a creational design pattern used to create objects internally without exposing the creation logic to Clients.
